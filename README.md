Experiments with dependently-typed programming in Idris2
========================================================

This repo contains various small-to-medium sized experiments
in dependently typed programming. For example:

* type-safe `printf`
* insertion sort with proof of correctness
* JSON parsing into a schema-indexed JSON type (inference and validation)
* type-safe implementation of a query language similar to SQL
* TODO: generic parsing / prettyprinting
